# Data Visualizations

I like sharing the things that I think are cool. My hope is that you might also think they're cool, and so I like spending time on fun visualizations that might convince you. I also hope that you will recognize that these visualizations are not too hard to make, and they can make concepts stick much better!

Take a look at some of the things I've made. All of the code to replicate these entirely locally are available on my GitHub in my data_visualizations project.
