Hi, I'm Jared. I'm a 1st year PhD student in Financial Economics at Northwestern, a joint program between the Economics and Finance departments. Previously, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve, Board of Governors, and a 2023 graduate of Vanderbilt University in Mathematics and Economics with Highest Honors. 

I'm interested in questions about the relationship between innovation and economic growth, how we can encourage positive technological innovation, and how to measure and remediate the negative consequences of technological change. Simply put, I'm interested in the relationship between technology, financial markets, and the macroeconomy.
