Hi, I'm Jared. I'm a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve, Board of Governors, and a 2023 graduate of Vanderbilt University with Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Economics with Highest Honors. I'm interested in questions about the relationship between innovation and economic growth, how we can encourage positive technological innovation, and how to measure and remediate the negative consequences of technological change. Simply put, I'm interested in the relationship between technology, financial markets, and the macroeconomy.

Currently, I'm doing research on a couple projects documenting relationships between macroeconomic events and financial market uncertainty.

After leaving the Fed, I intend to pursue a PhD in Economics or Finance to explore these topics further.
