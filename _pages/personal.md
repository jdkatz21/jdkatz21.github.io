I like economics. I also like other things. 

In college I was the President and Captain of Vanderbilt Men's Club Volleyball, where we were the DII AA National Champions. Nowadays, I play beach volleyball almost every day, weather permitting.

I started playing guitar after spending 3 years in Nashville and taking a class on the history of rock music. I listen to pretty much everything, but like playing classic or 2000's alternative rock. I'm learning to play the keyboard.
