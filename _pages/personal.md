I like economics. I also like other things. 

In college I was the President and Captain of Vanderbilt Men's Club Volleyball, where we were the DII AA National Champions. In 2023, I peaked as a top 200 Roundnet (aka Spikeball) player in the United States, was recognized as Premier status by the Spikeball Tour Series, and did some volunteer work for USA Roundnet, the governing body for the sport. I started playing guitar after spending 3 years in Nashville and taking a class on the history of rock music. I listen to pretty much everything, but play mostly classic or alternative rock. I'm learning to play the keyboard.
